👋 Hi, I'm Marwan Rafik, a young 19-year-old enthusiast. Fresh out of high school, where I refined my skills in Applied Sciences, 
I'm diving headfirst into the world of computer programming. Currently enrolled in an intensive training program, I'm specializing 
as a Cloud Developer, driven by my passion for leveraging technology to create innovative solutions.

👀 I'm interested in computer science, particularly cloud development, and chemistry, which I study at Sapienza University of Rome. 
Balancing the worlds of bits and molecules, I find joy in exploring the intricate realm of chemical reactions and computational algorithms.

🌱 I'm currently delving into advanced computer science topics through a specialized training course, focused on becoming a cloud 
developer, while continuing to explore the wonders of chemistry during my university studies.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to cloud computing, software development, and chemistry research.

📫 You can reach me via email: marwanrafik02@gmail.com.

💡 With boundless curiosity and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to 
expand my skill set. Whether it's mastering the latest programming language or unraveling the mysteries of molecular structures, I'm ready 
to embrace the journey and seize every learning opportunity that comes my way.
